# ESP8266 based H4n remote
This project may be some sort of wireless remote for the Zoom H4n audio
recorder some day. It is based on the nodemcu project and the research of
[Marcus Wolschon](http://marcuswolschon.blogspot.de/2012/04/easterhegg-basel-2012.html).

## Code
Well, it works - that's everything I've have to say about it currently. And
as it does exactly what I need don't rely on me to make a better project
out of this.
